                        We're 12 days in and you're still opening up these emails and tacking the lessons.
                        <br /><br /><strong>You are amazing.</strong>
                    </p><br />
                    <p>Today we're continuing our dive into flexbox by diving deeper into a few common navbar

                    <p>On top of the lessons, I also have a new challenge for you.</p><br />
                    <p>Today's lessons are a bit longer than usual, so there is no shame in<br /><br /> spreading them
                        out over the next few days.</p><br />
                    <p>The challenge is also the biggest so far too, and I want to give you enough time to<br /><br />
                        try and tackle it before I give the solution away, so I won't be giving the solution<br /><br />
                        away for 5 days.</p><br />
                    <p>We're almost 2-weeks into the course, so enjoy your lessons with the beverage of your<br /><br />
